Buzzer set up for Jeopardy

This system is used for players to buzz in to answer a question when playing jeopardy. On boot up, the LED strip flashes green indicating that it is ready to start. Any player must now press their button to start the game. Once the button is pressed the jeopardy song plays for about 15 seconds and then the game is ready to go. There are two teams with 3 buttons each. The host would read the question and whichever team presses their button first, is allowed to answer the given question. The team that presses their button first will be indicated with a unique light sequence on the LED strip. Once one of the teams has buzzed in, the other teams buttons have no function until the game resets for the next question.
